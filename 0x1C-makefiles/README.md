Makefiles
A Makefile is a special file used in software development projects to automate the build process. It contains a set of rules and dependencies that specify how to compile and link the source code files to create an executable or other desired output. The primary purpose of a Makefile is to manage the build process efficiently and ensure that only the necessary parts of the project are rebuilt when needed.

Key components of a Makefile include:

Targets: Targets are the output files or results that need to be built. They can be executables, object files, or any other artifacts of the build process.

Dependencies: Dependencies are files or other targets that a specific target depends on. If any dependency is modified or does not exist, the associated target is considered outdated and needs to be rebuilt.

Rules: Rules define the relationships between targets and dependencies. They specify how to build a target from its dependencies and often include the commands to execute.

Commands: Commands are the actual instructions or scripts to perform the build tasks. They are executed when a target needs to be rebuilt.
